# Conda Install

We _highly_ recommend using `conda` for package management. To install `av2-api`, simply run:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

which will install _all_ of the necessary dependencies in a conda environment named `av2`.

To activate your environment (i.e., update your system paths), run:

```bash
conda activate av2
```
